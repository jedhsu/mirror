## mirror

Homotopy theory - and perhaps category theory as a whole - centers around the perspective that structures and spaces, rather than set-theoretic points, should be the axiomatic objects of study. (Quote Corfield).

This post explores a non-Euclidean "mirror geometry" where the Euclidean line is the atomic element of a "point". In the mirror geometry, two points (Euclidean lines) form a line at their Euclidean intersection of a point.


Essentially:
* Points are lines.
* Lines are points.

Two points (lines) must form a line (point).

Chaos and depth are X and Y. [TODO] Show they are isomorphic!


Everything after doesn't make any sense yet, but will turn into a blog post after I organize and think more.






Point on how mirror points (Euclidean lines) seem to be higher infinite number than mirror lines (Euclidean points)?

Squares are transfer of heat energy?

Circles are constant, no distortion of "time".
- Points stay "constant in space".

"path restriction* is of a sphere

Imagine that the chaos is "chaos in frame of reference". Then "circles" are the only thing creating the illusion of space.
- Revised to "moving out and in at the same speed" is what is creating illusion  of space.

No 2-D invariance, that's key difference between dynamical systems?

Bottom Line:
- The universe is constantly growing in chaos and depth, but the constant velocity of both results in a fixed coordinate system in space,
  as both cancel each other out and you cannot tell (like the spaceship frame of reference thought piece).

Try and make a shape out of transfer of energy.

The analogue of the "form of a circle" - rotational invariance - is time. This generalized form of a circle is what to focus on,
the 2-D shape is counterintuitive.

For clarity, recall the 1-D circle.

You cannot go backward in time to the same degree you cannot shrink from the origin? because time is "radius". hmm.

**You must have two dimensions for the notion of rotation, it is (embedded).**

Yet the points are what form our particles?

The analogy on the number line is of "dense sequences" that converge to a transcendental.

Universal laws are the "lines" (they are points, areas of convergence and less chaos).

Feels like a fractal zooming in.

Note how the idea of "chaos" fundamentally only works (in terms of a quantitative ordering) with points as closed loops.

Energy is areas of greater chaos. spacetime is chaos at rest.
