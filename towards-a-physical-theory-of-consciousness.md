## Towards A Physical Theory of Consciousness

(under development)

The intuition on this conjecture is that consciousness is a physical result induced
by the principle of general relativity. The state of a communication network can be modeled by a
Hilbert space. The velocity of certain neural communication paths compute to faster than the speed of light
relative to an inertial frame of reference of a distance metric. The path realizations of neural communication
are a function of a collection of its past light cones.

### Hilbert spaces of a neural network

Here is mathematical theory that needs to be developed.

The brain can be modeled by a complex polyhedron. Each neuron is a vertex, and each synapse is an edge.

I hypothesize that this polyhedron can be modeled by a Hilbert space, or likely a "stack of Hilbert spaces",
where an edge is a point.

Attack:
* research proof on vibrating string as a space
* research representations of graph networks
* research parts of homotopy feels like it will be needed to reason precisely

Notes:
* Directed edges are presheafs on the small category of vertices.

### Research questions

Here are some research questions that need to be answered: 
* Does it make sense for a neuron to recall the state of its path evolution?
* Is there a strong enough understanding of the brain to make statements where certain types of networks are?
